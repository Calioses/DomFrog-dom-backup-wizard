## Overview

DomFrog Backup Wizard makes **live backups** of all your saves and new turns for your games. It’s designed to be working most of the time, kinda robust, and at minimum the backups should be reliable — using **default paths is recommended** for best results.

## Current Status

- **Installer:** In progress
- **Background process (daemon):** In progress
- **Save overwrites & recovery:** Planned
- **More robust tooling & GUI:** Planned
- **Cross-platform support:** Planned

Built-in Windows and Mac antivirus hate bootleg solutions so it'll take some time to implement the above.

## Support

My discord handle is @Monkeydew. I'll get around to messages and will likely have a support link in one of the more major dominions servers

## Warning ⚠️

This software was built and tested by an idiot.
